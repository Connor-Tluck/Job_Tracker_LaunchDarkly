3. **Create Feature Flags** (Choose one method):
   
   **Option A: Using CLI (Recommended - Fastest)**
   - Install LaunchDarkly CLI: `brew install launchdarkly/tap/ldcli` (or see [LAUNCHDARKLY_CLI_SETUP.md](./LAUNCHDARKLY_CLI_SETUP.md))
   - Authenticate: `ldcli login`
   - Import all flags: `npm run ld:import -- --project YOUR_PROJECT_KEY`
   - See [LAUNCHDARKLY_CLI_SETUP.md](./LAUNCHDARKLY_CLI_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
   
   **Option B: Manual Creation**
   - All 30 flags are documented in `LAUNCHDARKLY_FLAGS.md`
   - Create flags in LaunchDarkly dashboard using the keys from `launchdarkly/flags.json`
   - All flags default to `true` (ON) - you can toggle them in LaunchDarkly

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Access the admin dashboard at `/admin` (if `show-admin-page` flag is enabled)
